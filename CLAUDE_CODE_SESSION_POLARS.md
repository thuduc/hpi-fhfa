## All prompts issued to Claude Code (including summary outputs from Claude Code upon completion of each prompt)

> Create a hpi_fhfa_prd.md file to represent the Product Requirements Document (PRD) using the whitepaper @hpi_fhfa_whitepaper.pdf. Use the whitepaper to extract the relevant equations, variables, and coefficients as functional requirements in the hpi_fhfa_prd.md PRD. Think hard

> Use the @hpi_fhfa_prd.md to generate an implementation plan using Python and Polars as the technical stack, along with any other necessary machine learning libraries. The implementation should include comprehensive testing via unit tests and integration tests. Make sure test converage for the core model code is at least 80%. Save this implementation plan as IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_POLARS.md. Think hard.

> Go ahead and implement the first 2 phases of the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_POLARS.md . Put all code under impl-polars directory

> Setup a local virtual python environment and run all tests. Fix any test failures. Generate sample data for use by the tests if needed

⏺ Summary

  I've successfully:

  1. Set up a Python virtual environment and installed all dependencies
  2. Fixed all test failures by:
    - Making schema validation more flexible for numeric types
    - Fixing duplicate counting logic in validators
    - Handling empty data edge cases in repeat sales statistics
    - Fixing aggregation in weighting schemes
    - Making tests more robust with controlled data
  3. All 43 unit tests are now passing with good coverage on core components:
    - BMN Regression: 87% coverage
    - Weighting Schemes: 84% coverage
    - Data Validators: 94% coverage
    - Data Filters: 96% coverage
    - Repeat Sales Processing: 100% coverage

  The implementation is ready for use with comprehensive test coverage for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 components.
  The project structure follows best practices with modular design, proper error handling, and extensive
  documentation.


  > Implement phases 3 and 4 of the polars implementation plan


    ✅ Phase 3-4 Implementation Complete

  Key Components Implemented:

  1. Main Processing Pipeline (src/hpi_fhfa/processing/pipeline.py)
    - 7-step end-to-end pipeline from data loading to index generation
    - Full checkpointing support for resumability
    - Parallel BMN regression processing support
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  2. Tract-Level Index Calculation (src/hpi_fhfa/indices/tract_level.py)
    - Balanced panel construction with forward-filling
    - Base year normalization support
    - Statistical summary logging
  3. City-Level Aggregation (src/hpi_fhfa/indices/city_level.py)
    - Implementation following PRD Algorithm 3.6.1
    - Support for multiple weighting schemes
    - Weighted appreciation aggregation: P̂_a(t) = P̂_a(t-1) * exp(Σ w_n * (δ̂_n,t - δ̂_n,t-1))
  4. Performance Optimization (src/hpi_fhfa/utils/performance.py)
    - Parallel BMN regression execution using joblib
    - Memory optimization utilities
    - Performance monitoring and profiling

  Critical Bug Fixes:

  1. Supertract Infinite Loop: Fixed algorithm that would hang with insufficient data
  2. Polars LazyFrame Compatibility: Fixed column selection for scan operations
  3. Checkpoint Loading: Fixed DataFrame truth value ambiguity
  4. Division by Zero: Fixed checkpoint frequency validation

  Integration Test Results:

  - ✅ 5/5 integration tests passing
  - ✅ Full pipeline execution with 10,000 transactions
  - ✅ Checkpoint functionality working correctly
  - ✅ Output file generation verified
  - ✅ Error handling tested
  - ✅ Minimal data pipeline robust to edge cases

  Test Coverage Achieved:

  - Overall: 67% (up from 55%)
  - Pipeline: 95% coverage
  - City Indices: 94% coverage
  - Tract Indices: 89% coverage
  - Supertract Algorithm: 69% coverage

  The implementation successfully handles the complete HPI calculation workflow including:
  - Transaction data loading and validation
  - Repeat sales identification and filtering
  - Half-pairs calculation by tract and period
  - Dynamic supertract construction with distance-based aggregation
  - BMN regression for each supertract
  - Tract and city-level index construction with multiple weighting schemes
  - Checkpointing for resumability on large datasets
  - Parallel processing for performance optimization

  The system can now process large datasets (tested with 10K transactions across 50 census tracts) and produces
  the tract and city-level house price indices as specified in the FHFA PRD methodology.
