## Usage Examples

### Using Numba Optimization
```python
from hpi_fhfa.optimization import OptimizedBMNRegressor

# Automatically uses Numba if available
regressor = OptimizedBMNRegressor(use_numba=True)
results = regressor.fit(repeat_sales_pairs)
```

### Large-Scale Processing with Dask
```python
from hpi_fhfa.optimization import DaskHPIProcessor

processor = DaskHPIProcessor(client=dask_client)
ddf = processor.process_large_transactions(
    'large_transactions.csv',
    census_tracts,
    cbsa_code='12345'
)
indices = processor.build_indices_distributed(ddf, census_tracts, WeightType.SAMPLE)
```

### Validation Against Benchmarks
```python
from hpi_fhfa.validation import BenchmarkValidator

validator = BenchmarkValidator(correlation_threshold=0.95)
result = validator.validate_against_benchmark(
    calculated_index,
    benchmark_data
)
print(f"Validation passed: {result.is_valid}")
print(f"Correlation: {result.correlation:.3f}")
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```python
from hpi_fhfa.benchmarks import PerformanceBenchmark

benchmark = PerformanceBenchmark()
result = benchmark.benchmark_repeat_sales_construction(transactions)
print(f"Throughput: {result.throughput:.0f} records/second")
```
