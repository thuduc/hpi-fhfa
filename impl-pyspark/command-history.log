# Command History Log
# RSAI PySpark Implementation Session
# Date: July 12, 2025

## Session Summary
This log contains all user commands/prompts issued during the implementation and testing of the RSAI PySpark model.

---

## Command #1
"setup a local test infrastructure so that all tests requiring spark session will run and pass"

## Command #2
"fix the remaining test failures and do this iteratively untill all tests pass"

## Command #3
"perform test infrastructure refinements so that all test will pass. Make sure all tests are passing before stopping"
Note: User opened file /Users/duc/projects/claude/hpi-fhfa/impl-pyspark/FINAL_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPORT.md

## Command #4
"run all tests again and generate a summary of the test resutls"

## Command #5
"fix the remaining 3 test failures"

## Command #6
"save this test report"

## Command #7
"create a README.md file and document in details the following: functional summary of the model/code; how to run/use the model for inference; how to run the all the unit tests and integration tests including setup of scripts, environment variables, etc."
Note: User opened file /Users/duc/projects/claude/hpi-fhfa/impl-pyspark/FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md

## Command #8
"save all the commands/prompts that I've issued since the beginning to a command-history.log file in the current directory"

## Session Timeline

1. **Initial Task**: Set up local test infrastructure for Spark session tests
   - Implemented enhanced Spark session management
   - Fixed Java compatibility issues (Java 17 vs Java 19)
   - Created ordered test runner for better test execution

2. **Iterative Test Fixing**: Fixed remaining test failures
   - Fixed division by zero errors in validation
   - Fixed numpy serialization issues in UDFs
   - Fixed enum/string type conversion errors
   - Fixed ambiguous column references
   - Fixed column ordering and type mismatches

3. **Test Infrastructure Refinements**: Ensured all tests pass
   - Fixed visualization plotting error (duplicate index entries)
   - Fixed geography_id column resolution
   - Fixed enum attribute errors

4. **Test Summary Generation**: Ran comprehensive test suite
   - Generated detailed test results showing 91.5% success rate initially
   - Identified remaining 3 failures for final fixes

5. **Final Test Fixes**: Resolved last 3 test failures
   - Fixed Index Aggregation test (missing num_submarkets column)
   - Fixed Pipeline Integration test failures (column mismatch, session issues)
   - Fixed BMN regression creating empty period indices
   - Achieved 100% test success rate (59/59 tests passing)

6. **Documentation**: Saved comprehensive test report
   - Created FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md with detailed results
   - Documented all fixes and improvements
   - Included production readiness assessment

7. **README Creation**: Created comprehensive documentation
   - Functional summary of RSAI PySpark implementation
   - Detailed usage instructions for model inference
   - Complete testing guide with environment setup
   - Troubleshooting and performance tuning guidance

8. **Command History**: Generated this log file
