### How we verified the accuracy of the Product Requirements Document (PRD)
We used Claude Opus 4 LLM to generate the PRD from the whitepaper. In order to verify the accuracy of the PRD, we asked 2 other LLMs to perform the verification:
* ChatGPT o3's response: "A line-by-line comparison of the PRD with the mathematical definitions and data-handling rules in Contat & Larson (2022) shows that every equation, variable name, coefficient definition and threshold appearing in the PRD is consistent with the white-paper. No corrections are required."
* Gemini 2.5 Pro's response: "The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is correct in its representation of the equations, variables, and coefficients described in the FHFA whitepaper. My verification confirms that the mathematical and algorithmic specifications in the PRD accurately reflect the methodology detailed in the source document"

### How we verified the accuracy of the Implementation Plans
We used Claude Opus 4 LLM to generate the Pandas Implementaion Plan from the PRD. In order to verify the accuracy of the Pandas Implementation Plan, we asked 2 other LLMs to perform the verification:
* ChatGPT o3's response: "The implementation plan is largely consistent with the PRD—its formulas for the repeat-sales log-difference, the BMN regression, the pooled-index transform, and the weight-based city-level aggregation all match the equations in the PRD and use the correct symbol/variable names. However, a handful of details that matter for getting the numbers to line up in production are still missing or need tightening, especially around how the coefficient vector is anchored, how the index level is reconstructed at inference time, and how the six weighting variants are wired in code."
* Gemini 2.5 Pro's response: "The content of the implementation plan is a correct and thorough interpretation of the Product Requirements Document (PRD). It successfully translates the business and mathematical requirements into a well-structured technical plan using a modern Python data science stack. The plan correctly interprets the application of equations and variables for both model training and inference."

### How we verified the accuracy of the generated code for the Pandas implementation
Note: OpenAI's o3 and o4 LLMs are not known for their coding ability. Same with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. So we used Opus 4 LLM to independently verify.
For the Pandas code implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to independently analyze and verifiy the first 4 phases of the Pandas Implementation Plan (this is when the core model training and inferencing code is generated) to the code generated under impl-pandas/ directory. Here's its response:

  4. Consider caching supertract configurations across periods
  5. Add validation against known FHFA index values if available

  The implementation is highly correct and production-ready for the first 4 phases, with only minor improvements
  needed for full robustness.

### How we verified the accuracy of the generated code for the Polars implementation
Note: OpenAI's o3 and o4 LLMs are not known for their coding ability. Same with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. So we used Opus 4 LLM to independently verify.
For the Polars code implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to independently analyze and verifiy the first 2 phases of the Polars Implementation Plan (this is when the core model training and inferencing code is generated) to the code generated under impl-polars/ directory. Here's its response:

  Implementation Correctness Assessment

  Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - 95% Correct

  ✅ Project structure: Perfectly matches the plan
  ✅ Data loading and validation: Comprehensive implementation with support for multiple formats
  ✅ Polars schemas: Exact match to plan specifications
  ✅ Testing framework: Well-structured with pytest, unit/integration tests
  ✅ Transaction filtering: All three filters correctly implemented (same period, CAGR, cumulative appreciation)

  Phase 2: Core Algorithms (Weeks 3-5) - 92% Correct

  ✅ BMN regression: Properly implemented with sparse matrices, OLS/LSQR methods
  ✅ Supertract algorithm: Correctly merges tracts using Haversine distance to ensure MIN_HALF_PAIRS threshold
  ✅ Weighting schemes: All 6 weight types implemented (sample, value, unit, UPB, college, nonwhite)
  ✅ Repeat-sales identification: Efficient Polars implementation using window functions
  ✅ Half-pairs calculation: Correctly counts observations in both periods

  Key Strengths:

  1. Efficient Polars usage: Window functions, lazy evaluation, columnar operations
  2. Robust error handling: Custom exceptions, validation at each step
  3. Performance optimizations: Parallel processing support, sparse matrices, checkpointing
  4. Comprehensive testing: Unit tests with good coverage for core algorithms
  5. Constants match PRD: MIN_HALF_PAIRS=40, CAGR=30%, appreciation bounds=0.25x-10x

  Minor Areas for Improvement:

  1. UPB weights: Currently using transaction values as proxy (noted as placeholder)
  2. Test coverage: While tests exist, actual coverage metrics aren't available
  3. Geographic data validation: Could add more specific tract ID format validation

  Overall Assessment: 93% Correct Implementation

  The implementation is highly accurate and production-ready. The code follows best practices, efficiently uses Polars
   for data processing, and correctly implements the complex FHFA repeat-sales methodology. The modular architecture
  and comprehensive testing make it maintainable and reliable for processing the 63.3M repeat-sales pairs mentioned in
   the plan.

### How we verified the accuracy of the generated code for the PySpark implementation
Note: OpenAI's o3 and o4 LLMs are not known for their coding ability. Same with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. So we used Opus 4 LLM to independently verify.
For the PySpark code implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to independently analyze and verifiy the first 3 phases of the PySpark Implementation Plan (this is when the core model training and inferencing code is generated) to the code generated under impl-pyspark/ directory. Here's its response:

  Implementation Correctness: 92%

  Phase 1: Foundation ✓ (95%)

  - Data schemas: Perfectly match the plan specifications
  - Data ingestion pipeline: Well-implemented with proper partitioning strategies
  - Unit tests: Comprehensive coverage with proper test fixtures

  Phase 2: Core Algorithm ✓ (90%)

  - Repeat-sales pairs: Correctly implemented using self-join with window functions
  - Price relative calculation: Properly uses log difference formula
  - Supertract algorithm: Good implementation, though slightly simplified from plan (uses direct nearest neighbor
  rather than adjacency lists)
  - BMN regression: Correctly implemented with MLlib, sparse vectors, and no intercept

  Phase 3: Aggregation & Indexing ✓ (93%)

  - Weight calculations: All 6 weight types properly implemented
  - Index aggregation: Correct weighted average calculation with normalization
  - Cumulative index: Properly constructed using exponential of appreciation rates

  Key Strengths:

  1. Mathematical accuracy: Price relatives, CAGR, and appreciation rates calculated correctly
  2. Data quality: Comprehensive validation and filtering as per PRD specs
  3. Distributed processing: Proper use of Spark's distributed computing features
  4. Error handling: Robust handling of edge cases (insufficient data, missing values)
  5. Code organization: Clean separation of concerns, modular design

  Minor Deviations:

  1. Filter checks same year rather than 12-month period (reasonable simplification)
  2. Supertract merging uses simpler distance-based approach (still effective)
  3. Some solver configurations might not provide standard errors (handled gracefully)

  The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to the plan with high-quality, production-ready code that correctly
   implements the FHFA repeat-sales methodology.
